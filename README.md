**libdynarray**

This is a very simple library that implements a dynamic array in C. It somewhat
resembles vectors in C++. The library shouldn't have any prerequisites that are
not already present on your system.

To build the library, just run `make`. 
To build the example program, run `make example`.

This is a work-in-progress. I will document the usage of the library later, but
it shouldn't be *too* hard to figure out on your own. In the meantime,
example.c should cover basic usage.
